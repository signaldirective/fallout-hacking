# Fallout inspired terminal hacking game



Terminal hacking is where you find a password in a list of jumbled words, using feedback on matching letters and special bracket codes to narrow down choices within a limited number of tries. Select a word to see how many letters match in the correct position, then use similar words and bracket symbols like () or [] to remove "dud" words or even reset attempts, eventually finding the password to unlock the terminal.  

  

To start the game:  

``python fallout_hacking.py``

Without arguments, it will display the help file:
